        <p class="para">Reading is my 
            favorite hobby whenever I have free time or just any place. When I come back from school and finish doing some things then I pick up book if I have time. I am 11 years old and will be reading 6th grade standard books. Reading books is more expecting then what you can think and makes my heart happy and my mind. And the last reason I love reading is some books you can't put down until your down with.</p>
